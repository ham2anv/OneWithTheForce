The year is 50 ABY &mdash; 15 years after the [Battle of Exegol] and the defeat
of the [First Order] and [Sith Eternal]. While many hoped for a restoration of
peace and justice in the galaxy, no single power has arisen to unite them.
Instead, countless states span just one or maybe a small handful of systems.
Corporations and criminal syndicates carry on with business as usual. It's often
hard to tell the difference between chancellor, chairman, and capo.

Justice exists only for those who can secure it for themselves. For the wealthy,
there are plenty of mercenaries and private security services. For everyone
else, there's the Bounty Hunters Guild. That's where you come in. You're the
[Hunter], a member of the Guild in good standing, possessed of a nascent
connection to the Force which gives you an edge over your fellow hunters.
